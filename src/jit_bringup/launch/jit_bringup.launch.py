"""Bring-up for the JIT submarine stack.

WHAT CHANGED FROM THE OLD CHAINED LAUNCH
----------------------------------------
The previous launch file started one node, probed its topic, and only then
started the next. That encoded the old series architecture into the bring-up.
With a health bus it is the wrong shape: ordering is ``system_monitor_node``'s
job at runtime, and it already does it. Nothing can arm until ``jit/health``
says so, and until each node has checked in the monitor simply reports which
one it is still waiting on.

So: everything starts at once, everything respawns, and the runtime gate does
the sequencing.

THE ONE HARD GATE
-----------------
``gpio_estop_node`` is started with ``respawn=False`` and a handler that shuts
the whole launch down if it exits non-zero. That node exits non-zero when it
cannot claim its GPIO lines, when it cannot read the relay feedback, or when
the boot self-test finds the relay welded shut. A vehicle whose e-stop does not
work should not finish booting, and respawning it in a loop would just hide the
fault behind a wall of restarts.

Set ``boot_selftest:=false`` for bench work where the relay or the feedback LDO
is not connected.

Usage:
    ros2 launch jit_bringup jit_bringup.launch.py
    ros2 launch jit_bringup jit_bringup.launch.py enable_control:=false
    ros2 launch jit_bringup jit_bringup.launch.py boot_selftest:=false
