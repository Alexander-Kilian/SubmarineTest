// local_guided_node.cpp
//
// Waypoint tracking against the DVL-backed local pose, for ArduSub GUIDED mode.
// Publishes cmd/local_guided/setpoint (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped), which
// vehicle_interface_node forwards to /mavros/setpoint_position/local. This node
// holds no MAVROS client and cannot arm anything.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY ACCEPTANCE LOGIC LIVES HERE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ArduSub's GUIDED mode never declares a waypoint reached. Verified in the
// firmware source: guided_pos_control_run() calls wp_nav.update_wpnav() and
// never checks reached_wp_destination(). A position target in GUIDED is a
// station to hold, not a task to complete - the vehicle drives to it and holds
// there indefinitely. Only AUTO mode sequences waypoints, and AUTO needs
// lat/lon mission items and an EKF origin that can be set only once per power
// cycle, which does not fit the capture-a-datum-at-mode-entry approach below.
//
// So we do the acceptance test ourselves, deliberately mirroring ArduPilot's
// verify_nav_wp():
//
//   1. once the horizontal distance to the target is <= radius_m, latch
//      "reached" and stamp the time;
//   2. wait dwell_s from that stamp, then advance.
//
// The distance is NOT re-checked during the dwell - that matches the firmware,
// and it is the reason a tight radius is workable at all: the vehicle only has
// to touch the ball once, not stay inside it.
//
// A second consequence of the missing timeout matters for safety: stopping the
// setpoint stream does NOT stop the vehicle. Only leaving GUIDED does. That is
// vehicle_interface_node's job during safing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DATUM, DEPTH AND HEADING
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// On entry to LOCAL_GUIDED the node captures the current pose as the datum and
// the current depth as entry_z. Every waypoint is an OFFSET from that datum, so
// estimator drift accumulated since boot is absorbed at the moment the mission
// starts rather than being baked into absolute coordinates.
//
// Offsets are along the local ENU frame's axes (x = East, y = North), NOT
// rotated into the vehicle's heading at entry. A waypoint of {x: 2, y: 0} is
// two metres East of wherever the sub was, whichever way it was pointing.
//
// z defaults to entry_z - the vehicle holds the depth it started at, so it does
// not fight the trim changes seen during testing. A waypoint may override it
// with its own `z`, which is also an offset (negative = deeper, ENU).
//
// THE DEPTH OVERRIDE IS STICKY. Once a waypoint sets z, every later waypoint
// that omits z holds THAT depth, not entry_z. Without this, the intended
// mission structure - one dive waypoint followed by level translation
// waypoints - would command the sub back to the surface on the first
// translation leg, because those legs carry no z of their own. z_offset_for()
// is the single definition: walk the list to the index and take the last
// override seen. It is a pure function of the index, so there is no sticky
// state to get out of sync with a waypoint advance.
//
// Heading points along track: the bearing from the current position to the
// target. It is not an input - no waypoint carries an orientation - and it is
// never used to decide whether a target is new. vehicle_interface_node forwards
// on a position change alone, so the bearing that actually reaches the vehicle
// is always the one sampled at a waypoint advance, with the new target a full
// leg away. A value that is never sent from close in needs no close-in guard.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ACCEPTANCE AND THE VERTICAL AXIS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The horizontal test above is not sufficient on its own for a leg that
// changes depth. A waypoint directly below the datum has a horizontal distance
// of ~0 from the instant the mission starts, so a horizontal-only test latches
// "reached" immediately, dwells, and completes the mission without the vehicle
// ever descending.
//
// So the vertical axis is checked too, but ONLY on a leg that actually commands
// a depth change (see leg_changes_depth). On a level leg the depth error is
// ignored exactly as before, which matters because holding entry_z on the
// surface carries a persistent trim error that would otherwise block every
// acceptance forever.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// nav/local/submerged - RELAXING THE RC LINK-LOSS FAILSAFE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Submerging the vehicle submerges the ELRS antenna, which drops the RC link.
// Normally that is a fault: crsf_channel_node withdraws the relay permit and
// system_monitor_node raises RC_LINK_LOST, which is inside FAULT_SAFE_MASK.
// Both open the motor relay, so the vehicle cannot complete a submerged
// mission under power.
//
// This node therefore publishes nav/local/submerged: a statement of fact -
// "the mission is currently below the surface" - not a command. Two consumers
// decide policy from it, and each applies its own freshness check:
//
//   crsf_channel_node    holds crsf/relay_permit true and holds mode/request
//                        at the last live detent, but ONLY while the link is
//                        actually down. A live link means the operator's ESTOP
//                        detent works normally.
//   system_monitor_node  does not raise RC_LINK_LOST. CRSF_NODE_DEAD,
//                        MAVROS_LOST and ESTOP_NODE_DEAD are untouched.
//
// PUBLISH-ALWAYS, like crsf/link_ok. The flag goes out on every tick whatever
// the state, so silence on this topic means this process died - at which point
// both consumers time out within submerged_timeout_s and the failsafe re-arms.
//
// WHILE SUBMERGED THERE IS NO OPERATOR STOP. The switch is unreachable. What
// still stops the vehicle is: this node's max_submerged_s deadman, the
// independent backstop timer inside crsf_channel_node, MAVROS_LOST, the death
// of any of the three safety processes, and the mission completing. That is
// the whole list, and it is why the deadman is not optional.
//
// The flag is derived from the COMMANDED depth or the MEASURED depth, not from
// "the current waypoint has a z". Commanded, because it must be asserted before
// the descent begins rather than after the antenna is already under. Measured,
// because an ascent leg commands a shallow depth while the vehicle is still
// deep, and dropping the flag there would cut the motor rail halfway up.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RE-ENTRY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Leaving and re-entering LOCAL_GUIDED always recaptures the datum and always
// restarts at index 0. The operator's re-run gesture is therefore a single
// switch cycle. This is intentional for single-waypoint testing; it does mean
// that intervening mid-mission and returning walks the whole pattern.
